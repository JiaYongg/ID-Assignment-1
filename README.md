# Assignment-1

The webpage that I have created is based on a Korean-Pop Fansite. It includes having the Fandom logo, the latest released music video from the Korean Idol Group and a short description of what the newly released video theme is.

It also has a introductory page of each of the individual members serving the group, which includes their Stage name, Birth name, Position in the group, Birthdays and their Nationality. 

The webpage also has a Album Store page where fans can purchase the hottest album released and the group's newly released album at a reasonable price.

# External user's goal/ Site owner's goal
The purpose of this webpage is to promote (G)I-DLE's Fanbase and build up a larger audience if they were to hold a concert, and it is also to help the fans to get to know more about each members in the group and to promote their hottest/newest album release.
