# Technologies Used

HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript

HTML5 is being used to create the content of the web page while CSS3 handles the alignment of the webpage and making it look nice. CSS3 was also used to implement the Media Query where it aligns the web page and making it visible from a mobile point of view. JavaScript was also used to create a simple animation of the hamburger menu changing into an "X" and making the menu appear as drop-down navigation.

# Testing

User will be able to know more about each member by hovering their cursors over or tap on the picture of each member to view the description of them. User will also be able to shop through the Album Store located on the navigation bar.
